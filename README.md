This is a core courses in the Emphasis in Analytics, which covers topics fundamental to data analytics and machine learning. These four projects practice following abilities: Describe and contrast machine learning models,concepts and performance metrics. Analyze the complexity of algorithms and common abstract data types. Perform fundamental linear algebra operations, and recognize their role in machine learning algorithms. Apply machine learning models and statistical methods to datasets using Python and associated libraries.
